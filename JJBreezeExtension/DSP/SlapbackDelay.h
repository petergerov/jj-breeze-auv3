/**
    A short mono slapback echo — a single, distinct repeat (or a few, with
    feedback) of the input, damped in the feedback path for a warm, vintage
    tape-echo character rather than a bright digital repeat.

    This is deliberately separate from PitchShifter/ModulatedDelay: those
    exist to make the source *wider*, while a slapback is meant to stay
    centered/mono and be heard as a discrete echo, not a width effect. The
    caller feeds it a mono-summed input and adds its output equally to both
    output channels.
